In progress character sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System.

Styling is inspired primarily by GCS, but also with some influence from the official sheet. The goal was to design a reponsive character sheet that would look good even with a small screen width.


TODO
 - Add a damage calculator that:
    - Takes inputs for Damage Amount, Damage Type, and Location
    - Reduce amount by DR for location
    - Apply damage multiplier for type/location
 - Populate Swing and Thrust damage based on Striking ST.
 - Use Sw or Thr as options for weapon damage
