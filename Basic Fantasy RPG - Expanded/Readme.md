**Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game Sheet**
This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game core and some optional supplements.

**Features**
This version of the sheet incorporates roll templates, autocalculation of AC, and most other derived values. It does not require access to features of the Dev server or the API. It includes support for play with most of the optional supplements. This sheet is not compatible with the original Basic Fantasy sheet due to additional fields and naming convention.

November 21 - Fixed the coin weight formula.

**2017**
Jan 11 - Shifted weapon specialization down to combat section, editted wording on dice rolls, editted attribute modifiers so they do not show all the math but just results, editted secondary skills to include a modifier input, editted class skills to apply attribute mods to skill score instead of roll. Working on autocalculation for the encumbrance (code not included in this revision due to not working).

Feb 14 - Added racial modifier field to saving throws, a racial note field to the basic ability tab. Still working on the autocalculation but it is more on the back burner as real life takes the forefront.

March 2 - Removed unneeded sheetworker script.

**Credit Where Credit is Due**
The CSS and much of the layout is lifted from the work of allenmaher's BECMI sheet who lifted the excellent work of John Myles (@Actoba on roll20) and the 5e Dungeons and Dragons sheet.
